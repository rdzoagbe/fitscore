```

### Step 2 — Create Railway project

2. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Select your `fitscore` repo
4. Railway auto-detects the config from `railway.toml`

### Step 3 — Add environment variable

2. Add: `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your Anthropic API key
3. Railway will automatically rebuild and redeploy

### Step 4 — Get your URL
Railway gives you a public URL like `fitscore-production.up.railway.app`
